# Summary of Documentation Improvements

## What Was Added

### 1. **Benchmark Tests (TEST_SCENARIOS.md)**
Added Section 14 with 6 benchmark tests:
- Latency measurements (with expected <1ms for small frames)
- Throughput testing (frames/sec, MB/sec)
- Wrap-around overhead (<5% expected)
- Memory barrier cost (<100ns expected)
- Semaphore signaling overhead
- Buffer utilization under load

These will provide concrete performance numbers instead of assumptions.

### 2. **Capacity Planning (README.md)**
Added clear formulas with real examples:
- Basic formula: `payload_size = max_frame_size * 3 + overhead`
- 1080p video example: 20MB buffer
- 4K video example: 80MB buffer  
- Telemetry example: 8KB buffer
- Rules of thumb for sizing

### 3. **Health Monitoring (README.md)**
Simple utilization-based health:
- Healthy: <80% full
- Degraded: 80-95% full (warning logs)
- Critical: >95% full
- Formula: `utilization = (payload_size - payload_free_bytes) / payload_size * 100%`

### 4. **State Diagrams (README.md)**
Visual representation of valid states:
- Reader: Created → Waiting ↔ Reading → Processing
- Writer: Connecting → Connected → Writing ↔ Blocked
- Clear error transitions

### 5. **Security Model (README.md)**
Explicit statement:
- Designed for trusted internal use only
- No encryption or authentication
- Filesystem permissions only
- Optimized for lowest latency

## What We Didn't Add (and Why)

### 1. **Complex Monitoring Framework**
- Keep it simple: just expose utilization %
- Let applications decide how to monitor

### 2. **Performance Guarantees**
- Wait for benchmark results first
- Don't promise what we haven't measured

### 3. **Versioning/Migration**
- YAGNI - protocol is simple enough
- OIEB size check is sufficient

### 4. **Extensive Security**
- Explicitly out of scope
- Document it's for internal use only

## Next Steps

1. **Implement the 6 benchmark tests** to get real numbers
2. **Add health monitoring** to Reader/Writer classes
3. **Run benchmarks** on target hardware
4. **Update docs** with measured performance

This approach is pragmatic - we're adding what's needed for production use without over-engineering.
