# TEST_SCENARIOS.md Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Corrected Misconceptions
- **Removed "Reconnection" scenario** - Replaced with "Reader Replacement After Crash" to match actual use case where a new reader process is started
- **Removed "Sequence Number Overflow" test** - You're right, uint64_t won't overflow in practice

### 2. Added Critical Missing Tests

#### Error Handling Tests (Section 10)
- **10.1 Partial Initialization Failures** - Tests cleanup on failure paths
- **10.2 Corrupted OIEB Detection** - Tests validation of OIEB structure
- **10.3 Invalid Frame Header** - Tests handling of corrupted frame headers
- **10.4 Reader Death During Write** - Tests writer's detection of reader death mid-operation
- **10.5 Writer Death During Read** - Tests reader's detection of writer death
- **10.6 System Resource Exhaustion** - Tests behavior when system limits are hit
- **10.7 Permission Errors** - Tests cross-user access scenarios

#### Edge Case Tests (Section 11)
- **11.1 Zero-Sized Metadata Block** - Tests BufferConfig(0, payload_size)
- **11.2 Minimum Buffer Sizes** - Tests smallest viable buffer
- **11.3 Alternating Frame Sizes** - Tests rapid size changes
- **11.4 Semaphore Signal Coalescing** - Tests multiple signals before read
- **11.5 Reader Slower Than Writer** - Tests sustained backpressure

#### Protocol Compliance Tests (Section 13)
- **13.1 OIEB Consistency** - Verifies all OIEB fields update correctly
- **13.2 Memory Alignment Verification** - Tests 64-byte alignment requirement
- **13.3 Lock File Semantics** - Tests file locking behavior
- **13.4 Semaphore Naming Convention** - Tests name format compliance

### 3. Enhanced Existing Tests
- **5.4 Maximum Frame Size** - Changed from sequence overflow to testing frame size limits
- **5.5 Wrap-Around With Wasted Space** - Added test for wrap marker behavior
- **5.6 Continuous Free Space Calculation** - Added test for free space calculation logic

## Key Test Scenarios Still Needed in Implementation

Based on this updated TEST_SCENARIOS.md, the most critical tests to implement are:

1. **Sequence Number Gap Detection (7.2)** - Data integrity
2. **Memory Barrier Verification (7.3)** - Multi-core correctness
3. **Concurrent Initialization Race (3.2)** - Race condition prevention
4. **Invalid Frame Header (10.3)** - Error handling
5. **OIEB Corruption Detection (10.2)** - Protocol validation
6. **Reader Death During Write (10.4)** - Process lifecycle
7. **Zero-Sized Metadata Block (11.1)** - Edge case
8. **Wrap-Around With Wasted Space (5.5)** - Protocol compliance

These tests ensure the implementation correctly handles:
- Data corruption scenarios
- Process failures at any point
- Edge cases in buffer management
- Protocol compliance
- Error propagation
