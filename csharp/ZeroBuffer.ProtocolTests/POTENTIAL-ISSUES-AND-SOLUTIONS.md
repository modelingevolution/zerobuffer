# Potential Issues and Solutions for Multiprocess Test Runner

## Identified Challenges

### 1. Process Synchronization

**Issue**: Steps may execute before processes are ready to handle them.

**Solution**: 
- Implement a ready/heartbeat mechanism via JSON-RPC
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Use barriers for multi-process synchronization points

```csharp
public async Task WaitForProcessReady(string process, TimeSpan timeout)
{
    var deadline = DateTime.UtcNow + timeout;
    while (DateTime.UtcNow < deadline)
    {
        try
        {
            var result = await _rpc.InvokeAsync<bool>("ping");
            if (result) return;
        }
        catch { }
        await Task.Delay(100);
    }
    throw new TimeoutException($"Process {process} not ready");
}
```

### 2. Resource Cleanup

**Issue**: Failed tests may leave shared memory/semaphores allocated.

**Solution**:
- Implement a cleanup service that runs before/after each test
- Use unique buffer names with test run ID
- Add force cleanup option in platform servers

### 3. Platform-Specific Behavior

**Issue**: Some features may not be available on all platforms (e.g., zero-copy on Python).

**Solution**:
- Add capability discovery to platform servers
- Use conditional test execution based on capabilities
- Clear error messages for unsupported operations

```csharp
[Theory]
[MemberData(nameof(GetTestCases))]
public async Task RunScenario(ScenarioExecution execution)
{
    if (execution.RequiresCapability("zero-copy"))
    {
        var capabilities = await execution.GetPlatformCapabilities();
        if (!capabilities.SupportsZeroCopy)
        {
            throw new SkipException("Platform doesn't support zero-copy");
        }
    }
    await execution.RunAsync();
}
```

### 4. Debugging Complex Failures

**Issue**: When tests fail, it's hard to determine which process/platform combination caused the issue.

**Solution**:
- Capture stdout/stderr from all processes
- Add detailed logging with process/platform context
- Create test artifacts directory with logs per test

```csharp
public class TestArtifacts
{
    public void SaveProcessLogs(string testName, string platform, string process, string logs)
    {
        var path = Path.Combine(
            "test-artifacts",
            testName,
            $"{platform}-{process}.log"
        );
        File.WriteAllText(path, logs);
    }
}
```

### 5. Performance Impact

**Issue**: Running 9+ test variations for each scenario could be slow.

**Solution**:
- Parallel test execution with process pooling
- Reuse processes between tests when possible
- Smart test selection based on changed code

### 6. Complex State Management

**Issue**: Some scenarios require complex state coordination between processes.

**Solution**:
- Implement shared state service accessible via JSON-RPC
- Use correlation IDs for related operations
- Clear state between test runs

## Missing Features to Consider

### 1. Timeout Handling

Add per-step and per-scenario timeouts:

```gherkin
@timeout:5000
Scenario: Test with custom timeout
    Given the 'writer' process creates buffer
    ...
```

### 2. Performance Metrics

Capture and report performance data:

```csharp
public class StepMetrics
{
    public TimeSpan Duration { get; set; }
    public long MemoryUsed { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, object> Custom { get; set; }
}
```

### 3. Failure Recovery

Allow tests to specify recovery actions:

```gherkin
When the 'writer' process writes frame
    But if timeout occurs
    Then the 'writer' process retries with smaller frame
```

### 4. Platform Variants

Support platform-specific test variations:

```gherkin
@platform:windows
Scenario: Windows-specific test
    ...

@platform:linux,macos  
Scenario: Unix-specific test
    ...
```

### 5. Data Generators

Built-in data generation for common patterns:

```gherkin
When the 'writer' process writes frame with random data size '1024'
And the 'writer' process writes frame with pattern 'incrementing'
```

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic process management and single platform
2. **Add Platforms Incrementally**: Ensure C# works fully before adding C++/Python
3. **Focus on Diagnostics**: Good error messages and logging are crucial
4. **Test the Test Framework**: Unit test the multiprocess runner itself
5. **Document Patterns**: Create examples of common test patterns

## Architecture Benefits Confirmation

The multiprocess runner architecture provides:

✅ **True Cross-Platform Testing**: Real interop validation
✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new platforms
✅ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for tests
✅ **Debugging**: Clear process/platform context
✅ **Flexibility**: Supports complex multi-process scenarios

The concept is solid and addresses the core requirements well!
