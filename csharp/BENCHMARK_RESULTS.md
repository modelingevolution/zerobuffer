### Key Observations

1. **Excellent Low Latency**: The minimum round-trip latency is consistently around 600-680 μs across all frame rates, demonstrating the efficiency of the zero-copy implementation.

2. **Best Performance at High FPS**: The best overall performance was achieved at 500-1000 FPS with:
   - Average latency: 849-883 μs
   - P90 latency: 955-981 μs
   - Very consistent performance (low variance)

3. **Optimal at 240-500 FPS**: These rates showed the most consistent performance with:
   - 240 FPS: 853 μs average, 966 μs P90
   - 500 FPS: 849 μs average, 955 μs P90

4. **Frame Delivery**: All test runs successfully delivered 100% of frames (1000 sent, 1000 received).

### Performance Analysis

The C# implementation demonstrates:
- **Sub-millisecond average latency** for frame rates 60 FPS and above
- **Highly predictable performance** with P90 values typically under 1ms at higher frame rates
- **Efficient zero-copy operation** as evidenced by consistent minimum latencies around 600 μs
- **Excellent scalability** from 30 FPS to 1000 FPS

### Comparison with Python Implementation

| Metric | C# | Python | Difference |
|--------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Min Latency** | 605-677 μs | 963-1,159 μs | C# ~45% faster |
| **Avg Latency (1000 FPS)** | 883 μs | 1,195 μs | C# ~26% faster |
| **P50 Latency (1000 FPS)** | 905 μs | 1,154 μs | C# ~22% faster |
| **P99 Latency (1000 FPS)** | 1,127 μs | 1,721 μs | C# ~35% faster |

The C# implementation shows superior performance across all metrics:
- **Lower baseline latency**: ~350-480 μs lower minimum latency
- **Better average performance**: 25-30% faster on average
- **More consistent**: Lower variance between P50 and P99 values
- **Better tail latency**: Significantly better P99 performance

### Performance Characteristics

1. **Memory Management**: C#'s managed memory with unsafe operations provides better performance than Python's buffer protocol
2. **Runtime Overhead**: .NET's JIT compilation and optimizations result in lower runtime overhead compared to Python's interpreter
3. **Synchronization**: Platform-specific optimizations in .NET for semaphores and memory barriers
4. **Zero-Copy Efficiency**: Both implementations achieve true zero-copy, but C# has less overhead in the access path

### Conclusions

The C# ZeroBuffer implementation demonstrates excellent performance characteristics suitable for high-performance video streaming applications:
- Consistent sub-millisecond latencies
- Scalable from low to very high frame rates
- Predictable performance with low jitter
- 100% reliable frame delivery

The implementation successfully leverages .NET's performance capabilities while maintaining the zero-copy design principles, resulting in a high-performance IPC solution.
