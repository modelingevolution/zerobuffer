# ZeroBuffer Protocol Acceptance Test Scenarios

> **Note**: These test scenarios have been translated into Gherkin feature files for use with the SpecFlow-based test runner. See the feature files in:
> - C#: `/csharp/ZeroBuffer.ProtocolTests/Features/`
> - Python: `/python/tests/features/` (when implemented)
> - C++: `/cpp/tests/features/` (when implemented)

This document serves as the reference specification for all test scenarios.

## Test Execution Modes

The feature files support execution in multiple modes through the test runner configuration. Each scenario can be executed with different language implementations for readers and writers.

**IMPORTANT**: All test scenarios listed in this document MUST be executed in two different modes:

### Mode 1: Same Process
- Reader and Writer run in the same process (different threads)
- Tests in-process synchronization and memory barriers
- Faster execution, easier debugging
- Validates thread safety and memory consistency

### Mode 2: Separate Processes  
- Reader and Writer run in separate processes
- Test process should fork() or spawn child processes
- Tests true IPC behavior, process isolation, and crash handling
- Validates cross-process synchronization and shared memory semantics

Each test framework implementation should provide a way to run the entire test suite in both modes. Failures in either mode should be considered test failures.

## Test Architecture Design

### Test Numbering Scheme
Each test scenario MUST be assigned a unique numeric identifier following the section numbering:
- Test 1.1 = Test ID 101
- Test 1.2 = Test ID 102
- Test 1.3 = Test ID 103
- Test 2.1 = Test ID 201
- Test 10.3 = Test ID 1003
- etc.

### Implementation Structure

#### 1. Test Library (Shared Library/DLL)
```
zerobuffer_tests.so / zerobuffer_tests.dll
├── test_101_writer(buffer_name) - Writer side of test 1.1
├── test_101_reader(buffer_name) - Reader side of test 1.1
├── test_102_writer(buffer_name) - Writer side of test 1.2
├── test_102_reader(buffer_name) - Reader side of test 1.2
└── ... (all test scenarios)
```

#### 2. Test Runner Executable
```
zerobuffer_test_runner <mode> <test_id> <role> <buffer_name> [options]
  mode: "same-process" | "separate-process" | "cross-platform"
  test_id: 101, 102, 201, etc.
  role: "writer" | "reader" | "both" (both only for same-process)
  buffer_name: Unique name for this test run
```

#### 3. Helper Runner (for separate process/cross-platform)
```
zerobuffer_test_helper <language> <test_id> <role> <buffer_name>
  language: "cpp" | "csharp" | "python"
  test_id: Numeric test identifier
  role: "writer" | "reader"
  buffer_name: Buffer name to use
```

### Usage Examples

**Same Process Mode:**
```bash
zerobuffer_test_runner same-process 101 both test-buffer-xyz
```

**Separate Process Mode:**
```bash
# Main runner spawns two processes
zerobuffer_test_runner separate-process 101 writer test-buffer-xyz &
zerobuffer_test_runner separate-process 101 reader test-buffer-xyz
```

**Cross-Platform Mode:**
```bash
# C++ writer, C# reader
zerobuffer_test_helper cpp 101 writer test-buffer-xyz &
zerobuffer_test_helper csharp 101 reader test-buffer-xyz
```

This architecture enables:
- Single implementation of each test scenario
- Easy cross-platform testing by mixing languages
- Consistent test behavior across all modes
- Clear test identification and reproduction

## Test Execution Notes

- Each test should verify both success and failure paths
- All tests should clean up resources on completion
- Tests should be runnable in parallel with unique buffer names
- Memory corruption tests should use separate processes for safety
- Platform-specific tests should be conditionally executed
- All timeouts should be configurable for different system speeds
- Benchmark tests should run on isolated CPU cores for consistency

## Mode-Specific Considerations

### Same Process Mode (Mode 1)
- Process lifecycle tests (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) should simulate crashes using exceptions or thread termination
- PID checks will always show process as alive - tests should use alternative mechanisms
- Resource cleanup tests may need special handling since the process doesn't actually die
- Memory barriers are critical for correctness in this mode

### Separate Process Mode (Mode 2)
- Process lifecycle tests can use actual process termination (kill, abort)
- PID checks work as specified in the test scenarios
- Resource cleanup can be tested more realistically
- Fork() on Unix or CreateProcess() on Windows should be used
- Parent process should manage child process lifecycle

### Test Framework Requirements
- Test harness should provide a --mode flag or similar to select execution mode
- Each test should be written to work correctly in both modes
- Mode-specific behavior should be abstracted into helper functions
- Test results should clearly indicate which mode was used
