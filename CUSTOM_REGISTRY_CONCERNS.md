# Custom vcpkg Registry: Concerns and Solutions

## Overview of Concerns

When using a custom vcpkg registry instead of the official curated one, there are several considerations:

### 1. Maintenance Responsibility

**Concern**: You're responsible for all updates and fixes
**Impact**: Time and effort required
**Solution**: 
- Automate with GitHub Actions
- Use semantic versioning
- Document update process
- Consider having backup maintainers

### 2. No Binary Caching

**Concern**: Official vcpkg provides pre-built binaries
**Impact**: Users must build from source every time
**Solutions**:
- Set up GitHub Actions binary caching
- Use vcpkg's binary caching features
- Provide your own binary artifacts
- Document build times

Example binary cache setup:
```yaml
env:
  VCPKG_BINARY_SOURCES: "clear;x-gha,readwrite;files,${{ github.workspace }}/vcpkg-cache,readwrite"
```

### 3. Discovery and Trust

**Concern**: Users must find and trust your registry
**Impact**: Lower adoption, security concerns
**Solutions**:
- Sign your commits
- Use GitHub's verified badge
- Provide clear documentation
- Consider security audit
- Use reproducible builds

### 4. Version Update Process

**Concern**: No automatic updates from upstream
**Impact**: Manual work for each release
**Solution**: Automated workflow on release:

```yaml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

### 5. Dependency Management

**Concern**: Managing transitive dependencies
**Impact**: Complexity with Boost and other deps
**Solutions**:
- Let vcpkg handle dependencies from official registry
- Only your package comes from custom registry
- Test dependency combinations

### 6. Platform Coverage

**Concern**: Testing on all platforms
**Impact**: Potential platform-specific issues
**Solution**: CI matrix testing (already implemented)

### 7. Long-term Sustainability

**Concern**: What if you stop maintaining it?
**Impact**: Users stuck without updates
**Solutions**:
- Document migration path to official vcpkg
- Consider multiple maintainers
- Use GitHub's archive warning
- Provide fork instructions

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Official vcpkg | Custom Registry |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Setup Time | Weeks (review) | Hours |
| Control | Limited | Complete |
| Binary Cache | Provided | DIY |
| Trust | High | Variable |
| Maintenance | Microsoft | You |
| Flexibility | Low | High |
| Private Use | No | Yes |

## Best Practices for Custom Registries

### 1. Security
```bash
# Sign all commits
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Use protected branches
# Enable required reviews
# Enable status checks
```

### 2. Versioning
- Use semantic versioning strictly
- Tag every release
- Never delete tags
- Document breaking changes

### 3. Testing
- Test on Windows, Linux, macOS
- Test with different vcpkg versions
- Test upgrade paths
- Test with various CMake versions

### 4. Documentation
Always document:
- Current baseline SHA
- Installation steps
- Troubleshooting guide
- Migration instructions

### 5. Automation
Automate everything:
- Port updates on release
- Version database updates
- Testing
- Documentation updates

## Migration Strategy

If you later want to move to official vcpkg:

1. **Prepare**: Ensure port meets vcpkg standards
2. **Submit**: Create PR to Microsoft/vcpkg
3. **Transition Period**: Support both registries
4. **Deprecate**: Mark custom registry as deprecated
5. **Archive**: Archive custom registry with notice

Example deprecation notice:
```markdown
# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

ZeroBuffer is now available in official vcpkg:
```bash
vcpkg install zerobuffer
```

This registry is deprecated. Please migrate to official vcpkg.
```

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Backup Strategy
- Mirror on multiple git providers
- Regular backups
- Document restoration process

### 2. Bus Factor
- Multiple maintainers
- Clear documentation
- Automated processes
- Handover plan

### 3. Legal Considerations
- Clear license (MIT)
- No proprietary dependencies
- CLA for contributors
- Security policy

## Monitoring and Metrics

Track:
- Installation success rate
- Build times by platform
- Issue resolution time
- User adoption

## Conclusion

Custom registries are excellent for:
- Private/proprietary libraries
- Rapid iteration
- Full control
- Special requirements

But require:
- Ongoing maintenance
- User education
- Trust building
- Infrastructure

The automation we've set up minimizes most concerns, making it a viable option for ZeroBuffer distribution.
